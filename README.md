# Frctal site v0

### Manual Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrielzarate/frctal-site.git
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd frctal-site
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.
